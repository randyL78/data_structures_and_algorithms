# Data Structures and Algorithms

Listings for common algorithms in various languages such as C, C++, 
Ruby, Java, JavaScript. Not all patterns will be implemented in all 
languages.

## General Notes

Each structure or algorithm will have it's own readme that breaks down
the general description of the topic as well as an asymptotic analysis.
There will also be links to each of the actual implementations in the 
various languages.

Each language will have a separate folder with a single driver for all
structures. The individual structures will just be specific files/folders in 
that directory.
