# Vectors

Vectors are a form of list or dynamic array. They can grow and shrink and an
indexed item can be accessed in constant time. Their downfall is that adding 
and removing items involve a lot of work, especially the closer you get to
the beginning of the array.

In C++, the standard library includes a vector class that is intended to replace
the built in C style arrays.
